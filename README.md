EEPROM_Emulation application to show an eeprom emulation

The application requires two Flash memory sectors of identical size allocated to non-volatile data:
one that is initially erased, and offers byte-by-byte programmability; the other that is ready
to take over when the former sector needs to be garbage-collected.
