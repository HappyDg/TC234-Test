The External Request Unit (ERU) is a versatile event and pattern detection unit. Its major
task is the generation of interrupts based on selectable trigger events at different
inputs, e.g. to generate external interrupt requests if an edge occurs at an input pin.
The detected events can also be used by other modules to trigger or to gate modulespecific actions.
